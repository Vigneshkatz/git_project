# Learning Process

### 1. Feynman Technique
  Teach a topic to someone in order to learn better and this method shows where you are strong and where should  work on.
### 2. Implement this Feynman Technique
- Choose a topic.
- Try to explain to my roommate or my friend.
- Check the technical word in the explanation and simplify it as a kid could understand.
### 3. Paraphrase the video in detail in your own words
  The brain has two modes focus and relaxed mode which is switched back and forth. During the focus mode, a thought passes in the brain where a similar pattern is there while in the relaxed state, a new thought makes a new pattern. A relaxed state is where a new idea raises and this idea should be used as a base to pass into focused mode and develop the base idea.

  Procrastination is one strong barrier that should be crossed using willpower and the way to get rid of procrastination is either to go through it and eventually can overcome it or to turn the attention away from procrastination this seems good but over time this becomes an addiction.

  While learning new topics there should be exercises and frequent tests to ourselves this is an effective way to learn things. We should repeat until the topic comes like flow and recall the topic not reread. Finally, understanding is useless without practice and repetition. This makes mastery over the topic.
